# Coronary-Heart-Disease-Web-App
An ADL (App Dev League) Hackathon Project! Crush CHD is a machine learning web app that is fully responsive and adapts to different screen resolutions. It uses a real machine learning/AI model to predict whether or not a person has Coronary Heart Disease. Users can easily input their data via the left-hand panel that opens up. After data is put in successfully, hit the "Predict Results" button and wait for results to show up! Data visualizations of real life patients can also be viewed if the patient scrolls down on the main panel. The data that is visualized can be scrolled in and out.  

Instructions (Running)

1. Clone github repository to your machine. 

2. Open a terminal window in the project directory.

3. Run ```streamlit run ResourcesAndCode\webapp.py``` to run on localhost. 

4. If errors occur, you may need to install modules such as Streamlit via typing in the command line ```pip install streamlit```

5. After the web app runs successfully, navigate to ```localhost:8501``` and try it out!
